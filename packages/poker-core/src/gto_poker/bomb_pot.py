"""Bomb Pot — novel poker variant with action-first betting.

In a bomb pot, pre-flop action happens BEFORE the board is dealt.
Key twist: No fold option for players who posted straddle.
Straddle round is a mandatory action round.

Game model: straddle_map + junk_blinds + betting order

This is a novel variant — no existing open-source reference.
