Edge case regression tests for GTO solver bug fixes.

Tests for 5 recently-fixed bugs:
1. get_payoffs double-count: losers got negative payoffs equal to their contribution
2. Multi-way fold resolution: only checked last action's folder, not all folded players
3. bet: bet_to_call: used total_cost instead of max(contributions)
4. ICM chart suited/offsuit lookup: sorted key mapped all hands to suited entry
5. Dead code ternary in get_spot_analysis: always returned "fold"
